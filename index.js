/* Write a new function called variableInterestRate. This function should be the same as mortgageCalculator, except it should console.log the monthly payment for 10 different interest rates at 0.5% increments plus or minus 2% from the inputted interest rate. Complete these calculations using a for loop.

For example, variableInterestRate(200000, 0.04, 30) should console.log:

"{Name}, with an interest rate of 0.02, your monthly rate is $739"
"{Name}, with an interest rate of 0.025, your monthly rate is $790"
"{Name}, with an interest rate of 0.03, your monthly rate is $843"
"{Name}, with an interest rate of 0.035, your monthly rate is $898"
"{Name}, with an interest rate of 0.04, your monthly rate is $955"
"{Name}, with an interest rate of 0.045, your monthly rate is $1013"
"{Name}, with an interest rate of 0.05, your monthly rate is $1074"
"{Name}, with an interest rate of 0.055, your monthly rate is $1136"
